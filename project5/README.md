# DEAR DIARY... | Capstone CS50W

## Overview
My CS50W final project is the Dear Diary application, providing users a simple and modern online platform to write and manage diary entries. Users can create, edit, and delete entries, assign moods with smileys, and filter content by date and mood. Privacy is ensured, offering a personal and intimate space for self-expression. The application's focus on simplicity and ease of use aims to enable users to capture their experiences and emotions effectively.


## Distinctiveness and Complexity
The Dear Diary project distinguishes itself from other projects in the course by offering a personal and intimate space for self-expression, rather than being an e-commerce platform or a social networking site. It provides users with a modern and straightforward digital diary experience, akin to a personalized blog. The focus on individual experiences, emotions, and thoughts, coupled with features like password protection and mood-based filtering, sets it apart as a unique and private platform for personal reflections.


This project was a personal challenge for me as it involved working with technologies and concepts I had not previously encountered. As a beginner in web programming, I focused on enhancing my skills in JavaScript, a language I hadn't used before this course. Building the Dear Diary application allowed me to learn and implement various functionalities using JavaScript, providing valuable practical experience in web development. Throughout the project, I challenged myself to think critically and creatively, resulting in the successful implementation of several complex features. One of the notable challenges I faced was creating a mood filter page with custom radio buttons and efficiently fetching corresponding entries. Similar challenges arose in other parts of the project, such as the profile picture selection during registration and mood selection when creating an entry. Implementing the calendar functionality also presented hurdles, as I had to organize and display entries by years, months, and individual diary entries. However, I effectively overcame these obstacles by utilizing Django's date-based queries, specifically TruncMonth and __range, to accurately retrieve and present entries within specific timeframes. Additionally, I introduced a password protection feature to enhance privacy and security, and this required working with modals, handling form submissions, validating passwords, and ensuring secure backend storage. Mobile responsiveness was another crucial aspect that demanded a deep dive into responsive design principles. Skillfully incorporating elements such as sidebars and collapsible features, I aimed to ensure a seamless user experience on various devices.
